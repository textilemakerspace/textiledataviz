## How it works

A standard sewing machine has two threads: one coming through the needle and one coming up from the bobbin. These threads interlock as the fabric moves through the machine to create stitches.

Modern machines can typically do several (or even many) stitches: standard straight stitches, zig-zag stitches (one way to prevent fabric from unraveling at the edge, and can also be used with stretchy knit fabric in a pinch), buttonhole stitches (to create button holes), and possibly some decorative stitches.
