# DLCL 203: Data Visualization with Textiles

_DLCL 203: Data Visualization with Textiles_ is a 1-3 credit course offered by Quinn Dombrowski at Stanford University. It is by necessity organized as an independent study, not least because 25 people will not comfortably fit in the [Textile Makerspace](https://textilemakerspace.stanford.edu) at the same time.

The course is designed to introduce students to thinking about data: how do you go from reality to data? What are things that aren't obviously numeric that we can turn into data? How do you pick a textile medium to visualize your data, and what are the implications of different options? How do you incorporate different techniques and affordances of your chosen textile medium to represent aspects of the data? What is the relationship between _storytelling_ and _visualizing data_? We'll also be practicing _trying something_ as a way of getting unstuck and overcoming decision paralysis.

## Week 1: Welcome to Data Visualization with Textiles

For the first week of the quarter, you'll read a little about data, the history of data and textiles, and some of the options supported by the Textile Makerspace. Hopefully you can find a time to come visit the Textile Makerspace, or plan a visit for week 2.

- **Readings:** STUFF FROM THE HANDBOOK
- Will send out a survey with preferred workshop timing

## Week 2: Picking up Materials

Come to the Textile Makerspace and pick up some materials (if you don't already have your own). Make a very simple visualization based on data from your life this week.

- **Reading:** SOME STUFF ON DATA
- **Workshop:** Reading Sewing Patterns

## Week 3: Trying Textile Methods

Pick a textile method and spend some time trying it out! Think about how you might use it to represent data.

- **Workshop:** Crochet

## Week 4: Final Project Plans


## Week 5: Putting it Into Practice

- Meet with Quinn to talk about your final project
- Practice time for midterm (optional)
