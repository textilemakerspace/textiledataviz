# About DLCL 203

This course in its current form came about through a scheduling glitch: Quinn Dombrowski (Academic Technology Specialist, and director of the Textile Makerspace) intended to offer a very low-key, maximum 5-person independent study course at the Textile Makerspace as part of fulfilling the [Making@Stanford](https://making.stanford.edu/) goal of providing more making experiences for undergrads. Thanks to a quirk in how the class had been set up, there ended up being two sections available for registration -- including one Quinn could not see, which had 15 students register. Unable to turn that many students away, Quinn managed a very ad-hoc first version of the class in spring 2023.

In 2024, the 18 official slots in the class filled up immediately, and Quinn's inbox soon filled up as well with requests to join the class. With any luck, this resource will make the course more manageable even at ~25 students.
