# Data Visualization with Textiles

## Why textiles?

Visualization is ubiquitous for analyzing and presenting data, and many tools exist for visualizing data digitally. So why involve textiles?

Textiles are an expansive set of media, and the techniques for working with them are similarly diverse. You can use most of them to replicate familiar visualization techniques (bar and line graphs, pie charts), though usually with some loss in precision and fidelity. Where things get interesting for textile data visualization is when you leave behind the defaults you bring with you from digital visualization, and embrace the native affordances of textiles.

Digital data visualization has its own set of constraints: you have color and shape, possibly line style, and maybe options for some interactivity depending on the tool you're using (e.g. hover to see a label). Textiles offer additional dimensions for capturing facets of the data. In addition to color and shape, there's _texture_, which is related to _material_. For many textile crafts, there are different _stitches_ that can be used. _Tension_ is also relevant across different textile crafts. Having this many properties that can be employed -- individually or in combination -- to visualize data means making a different set of decisions than when working with the data visually. While aesthetics usually play some role in digital data visualization (if only in choosing a pre-set color palette that someone put some thought into), they are more significant for textile data visualization, especially if the visualization produced is also meant for use as clothing or decoration.

This project takes inspiration from _Dear Data_ by Stefanie Posavec and Giorgia Lupi, translating their style of hand-drawn creative visualization into another medium. At the same time, it connects back to a longer history of data and textiles, (EXAMPLES).

## Who is this for?

This project is designed as a resource for people interested in exploring textile data visualization, but assumes no prior experience with either textiles or data visualization. It is also written as a set of materials for _[DLCL 203: Data Visualization with Textiles](dlcl203.md)_, an independent study class held at Stanford University in the spring that uses the [Textile Makerspace](https://textilemakerspace.stanford.edu).
